A Dynamic Array is a linear ADT that combines the benefits of an index-based storage model with the ability to dynamically resize itself. It's often referred to as a resizable array, vector (in C++), or ArrayList (in Java).

1. Underlying Storage Model
Like a static array, a dynamic array is built on an index-based storage model. It stores its elements in a contiguous block of memory, which allows for fast, random access using an index.

2. Constraints
The dynamic array ADT imposes the same constraints as a static array, with one crucial difference:

Logical vs. Physical Size: It maintains both a logical size (the number of elements currently in the array) and a physical size (the total capacity of the underlying memory block). This allows it to handle changes in size without the rigid limitations of a static array.

Homogeneity: All elements must be of the same data type.

3. Operations
A dynamic array supports all the operations of a static array, but it also includes a key precomputation technique that allows for efficient resizing.

a. Access and Retrieval (Direct Query)
The get(index) and set(index, value) operations work identically to a static array. They provide constant-time access because the memory address is calculated directly from the index.

b. Insertion and Deletion (with a key optimization)
insert(value): When an element is added and the logical size exceeds the physical size, the dynamic array performs a resizing precomputation. This involves:

Creating a new, larger static array (often double the current physical size).

Copying all the elements from the old array to the new one.

Inserting the new element.

delete(): Deleting an element is similar to a static array, as it requires shifting elements to fill the gap. Some dynamic arrays may also perform a resizing operation to reduce their size if the logical size drops below a certain threshold.

While a single insertion that triggers a resize is a slow operation, these resizes are infrequent. This amortized analysis makes the dynamic array a practical and efficient ADT for most applications.

c. Navigation
traverse(): Just like a static array, you can iterate through the elements from start to finish, which is a form of linear navigation.
