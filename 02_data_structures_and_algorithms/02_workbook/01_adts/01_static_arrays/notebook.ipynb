    "# Static Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A Static Array is a foundational, linear ADT. It is defined by its core characteristics and the operations it supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Storage Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A Static Array is a quintessential example of an Index-Based Data Model. It relies on a contiguous block of memory where elements of the same size are stored sequentially. This fixed, ordered arrangement is what gives it its unique properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed Size: The size of the array is set when it is created and cannot be changed. This is a direct consequence of its index-based storage model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homogeneity: All elements in a static array must be of the same data type, and thus, the same size. This allows for the precise memory address calculations that define its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Operations\n",
    "a. Retrieval and Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- get(index): Returns the value at a specified index. This is a direct query because the memory address can be calculated instantly using the formula: start_address + index * element_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- set(index, value): Updates the value at a specified index. This is also a direct, constant-time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Navigation\n",
    "traverse(): Iterates through all elements from the beginning to the end. This is a form of linear navigation, typically performed using a single pointer or index.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Insertion and Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, static arrays do not support insertion and deletion because a static array has a fixed size at compile time."
