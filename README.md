# Hi, There

My name's Lusayo Nyondo, a multi-disciplined Software Engineer.

I've prepared this repo as a public record for my own learning and practice.

It contains notes, learnings, scribbles, and projects for everything I'm building in the following categories:

1. Application Software Development (Web and Native)
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Science and AI
4. Systems Software Development
5. Blockchain Engineering
6. Game Development

My goal is to develop a thorough command of computer science and build meaningful digital systems for positive social impact.
