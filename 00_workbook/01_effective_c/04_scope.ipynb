    "\n",
    "1. file - global, basically. outside any function or object.\n",
    "2. block - if it's declared within a block or the list of parameters of a block.\n",
    "3. function prototype - if a declaration appears within a function prototype, it is just scoped to that definition.\n",
    "    `void function(int a, int b);` <-- a and b have prototype scope probably.\n",
    "4. function scope - this is the area between the `{` and `}` of a function. Label names are the only things with this scope. So I suppose that means that you can declare a label in absolutely any block within a function and it'll be available in other blocks?\n",

    "Scopes can be nested. Inner scope has access to outer scope. Inner scope overrides outer scope."
