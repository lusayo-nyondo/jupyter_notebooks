# Hi, There

My name's Lusayo Nyondo, a multi-disciplined Software Engineer.

I've prepared this repo as a public record for my own learning and practice.

It contains notes, learnings, scribbles.

This is my own personal record of learning. My personal proof of work. My undeniable effort.

My goal is to develop a thorough command of computer science and build meaningful digital systems for positive social impact.
